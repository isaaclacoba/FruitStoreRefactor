FruitStore

Refactor project of a FruitStore

Dependencies:

- Maven 3
- JDK 1.8
- Mosquitto (Broker)
- H2 database
- Spring Boot
- Swagger2 (API documentation)

Testing using Mockito, JUnit and Spring test framework.

The project uses a simple layered architecture forme by three layers:
- Presentation: Composed by two classes, a controller that handles REST petitions and a mqtt client
- Domain: Composed by the service FruitService which contains the Domain logic. It receives petitions from the presentation layer,
    performs the actions necessary depending on the domain logic and invoke the data layer to persist and obtain the data needed.
- Data: this layer persists and give operations to abstract an H2 database through a repository.

Improvements:

One of the possible improvements that could be done in this project are divide the project in three maven artifacts, one for each layer.
This have several advantages:
- Allows better CI flow
- Improves the compilation time of the project since it is necessary to compile only the artifact that have been modified and not
the whole project.
- The work can be divide in a better way so different teams could work on each artifact independently.
